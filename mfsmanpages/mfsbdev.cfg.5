.SH NAME
mfsbdev.cfg \- \fBMooseFS\fP block device daemon config file
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This is the config file that can be read by the \fBmfbsdev\fP tool if the \fB-i\fP option was 
supplied along with the \fBstart\fP command.
The file contains definitions of block devices (one per line) that should be initialized 
when \fBmfsbdev\fP tool is started.
.PP
It is strongly recommended to not create this file from scratch. Instead, it's best to create all the
necessary devices using \fBmfsbdev\fP command and its parameters, as described in \fBmfsbdev\fP\|(8) 
and then list them with the \fBmfsbdev list -i\fP command and use the output to create a config file.
The following description is provided so it explains the content of the config file and allows to 
adjust it if necessary.
.SH FORMAT
.PP
Empty lines and lines that start with a semicolon (\fB;\fP) or hash (\fB#\fP) sign are ignored. Every other 
line should match the format:
.PP
\fIpath\fP [ \fIdevice\fP|\fB*\fP [ \fIlinkname\fP|\fB*\fP [ \fIsize\fP|\fB*\fP [ \fIbsize\fP|\fB*\fP [ \fIflags\fP ]]]]]
.PP
\fIpath\fP information is obligatory and should be a path to a file on MooseFS that will be
used as the block device; the path should be relative to MooseFS root or path defined with \fB-S\fP option
when starting \fBmfsbdev\fP, not your local file system root
.PP
\fIdevice\fP information is optional, if supplied should point to a network block device path 
(eg. /dev/nbd1); if not present or \fB*\fP is supplied, first available block device will be used
.PP
\fIlinkname\fP information is optional, if supplied should indicate the name of symbolic link 
created in '/dev/mfs', pointing at the network block device created by the map command; 
if not present or \fB*\fP is supplied, default link name will be used
.PP
\fIsize\fP information is optional, if supplied indicates block device size; if not present or \fB*\fP is supplied, 
the size of the file indicated by the first parameter is used
.PP
\fIbsize\fP information is optional, if supplied indicates block size; if not present or \fB*\fP is supplied,
4096 bytes block is used
.PP
\fIflags\fP information is optional, can contain the following flags 
(separated by comma if more than one is listed) \fBro\fP - read only device, \fBrw\fP read/write device, 
\fBlock\fP - device requires an appropriate type of lock (shared for \fBro\fP, exlusive for \fBrw\fP), \fBnolock\fP
- device does not require a lock (will try to obtain it, but will ignore failure); 
if nothing is supplied, the default of \fBrw\fP, \fBlock\fP is assumed; 
if two conflicting flags are supplied (i.e. \fBro\fP and \fBrw\fP or \fBlock\fP and \fBnolock\fP) the last one wins
.SH EXAMPLES
.PP
Create read/write devices with default block device path, default linkname, using file size as 
device size, with default block size:
.PP
.B my_devices/device1
.PP
.B my_devices/device2 * * * * rw
.PP
Create read only devices with specific parameters:
.PP
.B my_devices/device1 /dev/nbd3 mfsdevice1 67108864 1024 ro
.PP
.B my_devices/device2 /dev/nbd7 mfsdevice2 64MiB 1024 ro,nolock
