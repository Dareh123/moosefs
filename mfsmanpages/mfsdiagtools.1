.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBmfscheckfile\fP checks and prints number of chunks and number of chunk
copies belonging to specified file(s).
It can be used on any file, included deleted (\fItrash\fP).
.PP
\fBmfsfileinfo\fP prints location (\fIchunkserver\fP host and port) of each
chunk copy belonging to specified file(s).
It can be used on any file, including deleted (\fItrash\fP). Option \fB-q\fP turns on quick mode (only number of EC parts or valid copies).
Option \fB-c\fP turns on receiving chunk checksums from chunkservers, and finally \fB-s\fP turns on calculating file signature (from received checksums).
Option \fB-p\fP displays path to chunk file on chunkserver for each chunk. 
Option \fB-w\fP displays only "wrong" (invalid, missing, wrong version) chunks.
.PP
\fBmfsfilerepair\fP deals with broken files (those which cause I/O errors on
read operations) to make them partially readable. In case of chunk version mismatch,
it sets chunk version known to \fBmfsmaster\fP to highest one found on
chunkservers. In case there is no available copy of a chunk (all copies are invalid or missing), the chunk
is marked as "read-as-zeros" (read operation will return zeros, write operation will fail). When/if a chunkserver with the missing chunk connects,
the file will be fully available again. If option \fB-d\fP is used
then the missing/invalid chunk is permanently zeroed. Note: it is advisable to make a copy (not a snapshot) of any file repaired
with this tool, especially if there is a possibility that chunkservers with more existing chunks will be connected to the system in the future 
(for example after an outage). This it to prevent mismatched content of chunks with the same version in a file.
.PP
\fBmfsdirinfo\fP is extended, MooseFS-specific equivalent of \fBdu -s\fP
command. It prints a summary for each specified object (single file or
directory tree). If you only want to see one parameter, then add one of
show options (see \fBSHOW OPTIONS\fP). By default it returns data from internal
master counters (very fast, but not precise). All repeated nodes (hard links) and
chunks (snapshots) are counted multiple times. To count stats more preciselly
you can use \fB-p\fP switch which turns on slow, recursive procedure. In this mode
nodes and chunks are counted only once and the system uses current number of chunk
copies instead of goal/labels. System administrators might consider using \fBmfsmetadirinfo\fP (see \fBmfsmetadirinfo\fP(8)).
.PP
\fBmfsfilepaths\fP tool can be used to find all occurrences (hard links) of given file 
in filesystem. It can also be used to find a file with given inode number. 
In case of searching for inode number, the tool has to be run
in mfs mounted directory.
.SH GENERAL OPTIONS
Most \fBMooseFS\fP tools use \fB-n\fP, \fB-h\fP, \fB-H\fP, \fB-k\fP, \fB-m\fP and \fB-g\fP
options to select
format of printed numbers. \fB-n\fP causes to print exact numbers, \fB-h\fP
uses binary prefixes (Ki, Mi, Gi as 2^10, 2^20 etc.) while \fB-H\fP uses SI
prefixes (k, M, G as 10^3, 10^6 etc.). \fB-k\fP, \fB-m\fP and \fB-g\fP show plain numbers
respectivaly in kibis (binary kilo - 1024), mebis (binary mega - 1024^2)
and gibis (binary giga - 1024^3).
The same can be achieved by setting
\fBMFSHRFORMAT\fP environment variable to: \fB0\fP (exact numbers), \fB1\fP
or \fBh\fP (binary prefixes), \fB2\fP or \fBH\fP (SI prefixes), \fB3\fP or
\fBh+\fP (exact numbers and binary prefixes), \fB4\fP or \fBH+\fP (exact
numbers and SI prefixes). The default is to print just exact numbers.
.PP
Option \fB-?\fP displays short usage message.
