.SH NAME
mfstopology.cfg \- MooseFS network topology definitions
.SH DESCRIPTION
The file \fBmfstopology.cfg\fP assigns IP addresses to
network locations. This file is optional. If your
network is very small (i.e. has just one switch) or
network topology is not necessary
then leave this file empty.
.SS SYNTAX
.PP
Syntax is:
.TP
\fIIP_ADDRESSES\fP \fILOCATION_PATH\fP
.PP
Lines starting with \fB#\fP character are ignored as comments.
.PP
\fIIP_ADDRESS\fP can be specified in several forms:
.PP
.nf
.ta +2i
\fB*\fP	all addresses
\fBn.n.n.n\fP	single IP address
\fBn.n.n.n/b\fP	IP class specified by network address and bits number
\fBn.n.n.n/m.m.m.m\fP	IP class specified by network address and mask
\fBf.f.f.f-t.t.t.t\fP	IP range specified by from-to addresses (inclusive)
.fi
.PP
\fILOCATION_PATH\fP can be specified as a sequence of words separated by vertical bars.
.SH NOTES
If one IP belongs to more than one definition then the last definition is used.
.PP
Each set of ip addresses with a common location path is considered one rack. Rack and/or IP information is used
by the master if \fBCHUNKS_UNIQUE_MODE\fP in \fBmfsmaster.cfg\fP is set to value greater than 0 
(refer to \fBmfsmaster.cfg\fP\|(5) manual for more information) and in storage classes if the 
distinguish feature is used (refer to \fBmfsscadmin\fP\|(1) manual for more information).
.PP
Distance between IP numbers is defined as follows: \fB0\fP when IP numbers are the same,
\fB1\fP when IP numbers are different, but paths specified by these numbers are the same. In case of different
paths distance is defined as one plus maximum number of elements from both paths after 
common starting part.
.PP
Distance is used for the following purposes:
.br
Copies of chunks are sent to the client(mount) sorted by the distance from this client when a chunk is needed for I/O operations. Notice that
the client may alter that order based on internal settings (preferred labels or internal congestion preventing algorithms; for
more informations about preferred labels refer to \fBmfsmount\fP\|(8) manual).
.br
In the master the distance and racks information is used when \fBCREATIONS_RESPECT_TOPOLOGY\fP 
and/or \fBREPLICATIONS_RESPECT_TOPOLOGY\fP are set to value greater than 0. 
For more information refer to \fBmfsmaster.cfg\fP\|(5) manual.

.SS DISTANCE EXAMPLES
Distances calculated for two different IP numbers mapped to given location paths:
.PP
d('US','DE') = 2
.PP
d('US','') = 2
.PP
d('US|PHOENIX|AT&T|RACK1','US|PHOENIX|AT&T|RACK2') = 2
.PP
d('US|PHOENIX|AT&T|RACK1','US|PHOENIX|ATM|RACK7') = 3
.PP
d('US|PHOENIX|AT&T|RACK1','US|CHICAGO|AT&T|RACK2') = 4
.PP
d('US|PHOENIX|AT&T|RACK1','US|ATM') = 4
.PP
d('US|PHOENIX|AT&T|RACK1','DE|BERLIN|ATM|RACK175') = 5
