.SH DESCRIPTION
These tools operate on object's \fIstorage class\fP name. This is an extended version of classic goal.
There are predefined storage classes provided as equivalents of goals 1 to 9 (names are simply "1","2",...,"9"). Other classes 
can be created/modified/deleted etc. by administrator using \fBmfsscadmin\fP tool.
.PP
\fBmfsgetsclass\fP prints current \fIstorage class\fP of given object(s).
\fB-r\fP option enables recursive mode, for files there is no difference,
for directories it shows the number of objects in each \fIstorage class\fP
containded in the whole subtree of this directory.
.PP
\fBmfssetsclass\fP changes current \fIstorage class\fP of given object(s).
\fB-r\fP option enables recursive mode.
.PP
\fBmfscopysclass\fP copies \fIstorage class\fP from one object to given object(s).
.PP
\fBmfsxchgsclass\fP sets \fIstorage class\fP to \fIDST_SCLASS_NAME\fP of given objects(s) but only
when current \fIstorage class\fP is set to \fISRC_SCLASS_NAME\fP.
.SH GENERAL OPTIONS
Most \fBMooseFS\fP tools use \fB-n\fP, \fB-h\fP, \fB-H\fP, \fB-k\fP, \fB-m\fP and \fB-g\fP
options to select
format of printed numbers. \fB-n\fP causes to print exact numbers, \fB-h\fP
uses binary prefixes (Ki, Mi, Gi as 2^10, 2^20 etc.) while \fB-H\fP uses SI
prefixes (k, M, G as 10^3, 10^6 etc.). \fB-k\fP, \fB-m\fP and \fB-g\fP show plain numbers
respectivaly in kibis (binary kilo - 1024), mebis (binary mega - 1024^2)
and gibis (binary giga - 1024^3).
The same can be achieved by setting
\fBMFSHRFORMAT\fP environment variable to: \fB0\fP (exact numbers), \fB1\fP
or \fBh\fP (binary prefixes), \fB2\fP or \fBH\fP (SI prefixes), \fB3\fP or
\fBh+\fP (exact numbers and binary prefixes), \fB4\fP or \fBH+\fP (exact
numbers and SI prefixes). The default is to print just exact numbers.
.PP
Option \fB-?\fP displays short usage message.
.SH INHERITANCE
When a new object is created in MooseFS, storage class is inherited from the parent directory. A newly created
object inherits always the current value of its parent's storage class. Changing a
directory's storage class does not affect its already created children. To change
storage class for a directory and all of its children use \fB-r\fP option.
