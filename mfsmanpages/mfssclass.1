.SH DESCRIPTION
These tools operate on a filesystem object's (file, special file, or directory) \fIstorage class\fP name.
This is an extended version of the older MooseFS's goal mechanism.
There are several predefined storage classes in each fresh installation of MooseFS (see NOTES).
Other classes can be created/modified/deleted etc., by an administrator using the \fBmfsscadmin\fP tool.
.PP
\fBmfsgetsclass\fP prints current \fIstorage class\fP of given object(s).
\fB-r\fP option enables recursive mode:
for directories, it shows the number of objects in each \fIstorage class\fP
containded in the whole subtree of this directory.
for files there is no difference.
.PP
\fBmfssetsclass\fP changes the current \fIstorage class\fP of given object(s).
\fB-r\fP option enables recursive mode.
.PP
\fBmfscopysclass\fP copies \fIstorage class\fP from one object to given object(s).
.PP
\fBmfsxchgsclass\fP sets \fIstorage class\fP of given objects(s) to \fIDST_SCLASS_NAME\fP, but only
when current \fIstorage class\fP is set to \fISRC_SCLASS_NAME\fP.
.SH OPTIONS
Most \fBMooseFS\fP tools use \fB-n\fP, \fB-h\fP, \fB-H\fP, \fB-k\fP, \fB-m\fP and \fB-g\fP
options to select
format of printed numbers. \fB-n\fP causes to print exact numbers, \fB-h\fP
uses binary prefixes (Ki, Mi, Gi as 2^10, 2^20 etc.) while \fB-H\fP uses SI
prefixes (k, M, G as 10^3, 10^6 etc.). \fB-k\fP, \fB-m\fP and \fB-g\fP show plain numbers
respectivaly in kibis (binary kilo - 1024), mebis (binary mega - 1024^2)
and gibis (binary giga - 1024^3).
The same can be achieved by setting
\fBMFSHRFORMAT\fP environment variable to: \fB0\fP (exact numbers), \fB1\fP
or \fBh\fP (binary prefixes), \fB2\fP or \fBH\fP (SI prefixes), \fB3\fP or
\fBh+\fP (exact numbers and binary prefixes), \fB4\fP or \fBH+\fP (exact
numbers and SI prefixes). The default is to print just exact numbers.
.PP
Option \fB-?\fP displays a short usage message.
.SH NOTES
.SS INHERITANCE
When a new object is created in MooseFS, the storage class is inherited from the parent directory. 
A newly created object inherits always the current value of its parent's storage class. 
Changing a directory's storage class does not affect its already created children. 
To change the storage class for a directory and all of its children, use the \fB-r\fP option.
.SS PREDEFINED STORAGE CLASSES
.PP
A new MooseFS instance will have the following classes predefined:
.PP
2CP - only KEEP state defined, keep 2 copies on any labels (default class for / directory)
.PP
3CP - only KEEP state defined, keep 3 copies on any labels
.PP
EC4+1 - in KEEP state, keep 2 copies on any labels, in ARCHIVE state, keep chunks in EC4+1 format on any labels, archive delay is 1 day and is calculated using file's ctime, files smaller than 512kiB will not be converted to EC format
.PP
EC4+2 - (pro only) in KEEP state, keep 3 copies on any labels, in ARCHIVE state, keep chunks in EC4+2 format on any labels, archive delay is 1 day and is calculated using file's ctime, files smaller than 512kiB will not be converted to EC format
.PP
EC8+1 - in KEEP state, keep 2 copies on any labels, in ARCHIVE state, keep chunks in EC8+1 format on any labels, archive delay is 1 day and is calculated using file's ctime, files smaller than 512kiB will not be converted to EC format
.PP
EC8+2 - (pro only) in KEEP state, keep 3 copies on any labels, in ARCHIVE state, keep chunks in EC8+2 format on any labels, archive delay is 1 day and is calculated using file's ctime, files smaller than 512kiB will not be converted to EC format
.PP
Up to version 4.56.0 of MooseFS the predefined classes were different. The following information 
pertains to old MooseFS behaviour. In newer versions of MooseFS the classes mentioned below might 
exist as a result of an upgrade, but will behave exactly like any user-defined classes. This information 
is left here purely for informative reasons and will be removed from this manual page at some point:
.PP
(Behaviour up to version 4.56.0) "For compatibility reasons, every fresh or freshly upgraded instance of MooseFS has 9 predefined
storage classes. Their names are single digits, from \fB1\fP to \fB9\fP, and their definitions
are \fB*\fP to \fB9*\fP. They
are equivalents of simple numeric goals from previous versions of the system. In case of an
upgrade, all files that had goal \fIN\fP before upgrade, will now have \fIN\fP storage class.
These classes can be modified only when option \fB-f\fP is specified. It is advised to create new
storage classes in an upgraded system and migrate files with \fBmfsxchgsclass\fP tool, rather than
modify the predefined classes. The predefined classes CANNOT be deleted."
